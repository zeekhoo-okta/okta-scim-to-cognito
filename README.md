# Understanding of User Provisioning in Okta

Okta is a universal directory with the main focus in storing
identity related information.  Users can be created in Okta directly
as local users or imported from external systems like Active
Directory or a [Human Resource Management Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Human_resource_management_software) system.

An Okta user schema contains many different user attributes,
but always contains a user name, first name, last name, and
email address. This schema can be extended.

Okta user attributes can be mapped from a source into Okta and can
be mapped from Okta to a target.

Below are the main operations in Okta's SCIM user provisioning lifecycle:

1.  Create a user account.
2.  Read a list of accounts, with support for searching for a preexisting account.
3.  Update an account (user profile changes, entitlement changes, etc).
4.  Deactivate an account.

In Okta, an application instance is a connector that provides Single Sign-On
and provisioning functionality with the target application.


# Required SCIM Capabilities

Okta supports provisioning to both SCIM 1.1 and SCIM 2.0 APIs.

If you haven't implemented SCIM, Okta recommends that you implement
SCIM 2.0.

Okta implements SCIM 2.0 as described in RFCs [7642](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7642), [7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643), [7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

If you are writing a SCIM implementation for the first time, an
important part of the planning process is determining which of
Okta's provisioning features your SCIM API can or should support and
which features you do not need to support.

Specifically, you do not need to implement the SCIM 2.0
specification fully to work with Okta. At a minimum, Okta requires that
your SCIM 2.0 API implement the features described below:

## Base URL

The API endpoint for your SCIM API **MUST** be secured via [TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246)
(`https://`), Okta *does not* connect to unsecured API endpoints.

You can choose any Base URL for your API endpoint. If you
are implementing a brand new SCIM API, we suggest using `/scim/v2`
as your Base URL; for example: `https://example.com/scim/v2` -
however, you must support the URL structure described in the
["SCIM Endpoints and HTTP Methods" section of RFC7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.2).

## Authentication

Your SCIM API **MUST** be secured against anonymous access. At the
moment, Okta supports authentication against SCIM APIs with one of
the following methods:

1.  [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)
2.  [Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
3.  Custom HTTP Header

## Basic User Schema

Your service must be capable of storing the following four user
attributes:

1.  User ID (`userName`)
2.  First Name (`name.givenName`)
3.  Last Name (`name.familyName`)
4.  Email (`emails`)

Note that Okta supports more than the four user attributes listed
above. However, these four attributes are the base attributes that
you must support.  The full user schema for SCIM 2.0 is described
in [section 4 of RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643#section-4).

> **Best Practice:** Keep your User ID distinct from the User Email
> Address. Many systems use an email address as a user identifier,
> but this is not recommended, as email addresses often change. Using
> a unique User ID to identify user resources prevents future
> complications.

If your service supports user attributes beyond those four base
attributes, add support for those additional
attributes to your SCIM API. In some cases, you might need to
configure Okta to map non-standard user attributes into the user
profile for your application.
